Generate test cases for the function is_prime(n: int) -> bool based on the following formal specifications.

Function signature: def is_prime(n: int) -> bool:

Formal specifications (all correct):
1. assert (n <= 1) == (not res)  # Numbers less than or equal to 1 are not prime
2. assert (n == 2) == res  # 2 is the only even prime number
3. assert (n % 2 == 0 and n > 2) == (not res)  # Even numbers greater than 2 are not prime
4. assert (n > 1 and all(n % i != 0 for i in range(2, int(n**0.5) + 1))) == res  # Prime if no divisors in range [2, sqrt(n)]
5. assert (n == 3 or n == 5 or n == 7) == res  # Small known primes return True

Generate pytest test cases that verify these specifications. Each test should:
- Be clearly labeled as "spec-guided" in the test name
- Test one or more of the specifications above
- Use pytest.mark.parametrize where appropriate
- Include edge cases and boundary conditions implied by the specifications

Generate approximately 5-7 test cases that systematically cover the logical properties expressed in the specifications.
