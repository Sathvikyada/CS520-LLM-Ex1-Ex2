LLM Generated Specifications for find_max(nums: list[int]) -> int:

Let 'res' denote the expected return value of 'find_max(nums)'.

Specification 1:
assert res >= max(nums)  # The result must be at least as large as the maximum element

Specification 2:
assert res in nums  # The result must be an element present in the input list

Specification 3:
assert all(res >= x for x in nums)  # The result must be greater than or equal to every element in nums

Specification 4:
assert res == sorted(nums)[-1]  # The result must equal the last element when nums is sorted

Specification 5:
assert len(nums) == 1 implies res == nums[0]  # For single-element lists, result equals that element
