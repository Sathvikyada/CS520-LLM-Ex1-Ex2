Evaluation of LLM Specifications for Problem 8

Specification 1:
LLM Generated: assert (n <= 1) == (not res)  # Numbers less than or equal to 1 are not prime
Status: CORRECT
Explanation: This tests that for n <= 1, the result must be False (not prime) so this is valid.

Specification 2:
LLM Generated: assert (n == 2) == res  # 2 is the only even prime number
Status: CORRECT
Explanation: This correctly tests that when n equals 2, the result must be True which is a boundary case.

Specification 3:
LLM Generated: assert (n % 2 == 0 and n > 2) == (not res)  # Even numbers greater than 2 are not prime
Status: CORRECT
Explanation: This correctly tests that even numbers greater than 2 are composite which is valid.

Specification 4:
LLM Generated: assert (n > 1 and all(n % i != 0 for i in range(2, int(n**0.5) + 1))) == res  # Prime if no divisors in range [2, sqrt(n)]
Status: CORRECT
Explanation: This is the mathematical definition of a prime number: n > 1 and has no divisors in the range [2, sqrt(n)] so this would be valid.

Specification 5:
LLM Generated: assert (n == 3 or n == 5 or n == 7) == res  # Small known primes return True
Status: CORRECT
Explanation: This correctly tests specific small prime numbers (base case) which is valid.

ACCURACY RATE: 5/5 = 100% (5 correct, 0 incorrect)
