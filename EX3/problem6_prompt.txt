Problem description: Write a function that returns the maximum value in a list without using the built-in `max()` function. The function takes a list of integers (non-empty) and returns the largest integer in the list.

Method signature: def find_max(nums: list[int]) -> int:

Please write formal specifications as Python assertions that describe the correct behavior of this method.

Let 'res' denote the expected return value of 'find_max(nums)'.

Do not use methods with side effects such as print(), file I/O, random number generation, or timing functions.

Express the relationship between 'nums' and 'res' using pure arithmetic, boolean logic, and list operations only.

Generate 5 distinct specifications that cover various cases including boundary conditions, edge cases, and general behavior.
