Problem description: Write a function that returns True if the integer n is a prime number, and False otherwise. The function takes an integer greater than or equal to 0.

Method signature: def is_prime(n: int) -> bool:

Please write formal specifications as Python assertions that describe the correct behavior of this method.

Let 'res' denote the expected return value of 'is_prime(n)'.

Do not call 'is_prime()' in your assertions.

Do not use methods with side effects such as print(), file I/O, random number generation, or timing functions.

Express the relationship between 'n' and 'res' using pure arithmetic and boolean logic only.

Generate approximately 5 distinct specifications that cover various cases including boundary conditions, edge cases, and general behavior.
