Evaluation of LLM Specifications for Problem 6

Specification 1:
LLM Generated: assert res >= max(nums)
This is INCORRECT
Problem: This uses the built-in max() function, which is not allowed. This is a problem because we are trying to test the behavior of find_max and not use max() to verify it.
Corrected Version: assert all(res >= x for x in nums)
# This would be a duplicate with specification 3 so we can remove this one.

Specification 2:
LLM Generated: assert res in nums  # The result must be an element present in the input list
Status: CORRECT
Explanation: The maximum value must be one of the elements in the input list so this is valid.

Specification 3:
LLM Generated: assert all(res >= x for x in nums)  # The result must be greater than or equal to every element in nums
Status: CORRECT
Explanation: This correctly tests that the result must be at least as large as every element in the list which is valid.

Specification 4:
LLM Generated: assert res == sorted(nums)[-1]  # The result must equal the last element when nums is sorted
Status: INCORRECT
Problem: sorted() creates a new list and uses list operations beyond pure arithmetic/boolean logic.
Corrected Version: assert res in nums and all(res >= x for x in nums)

Specification 5:
LLM Generated: assert (len(nums) != 1) or (res == nums[0])   # For single-element lists, result equals that element
Status: CORRECT
Explanation: For a single-index list, the maximum is only that one number so this is valid.

ACCURACY RATE: 3/5 = 60% (3 correct, 2 incorrect)
