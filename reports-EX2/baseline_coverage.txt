Baseline Coverage Summary

    Problem       Tests Passed   Line %   Branch %                  Notes
1 – sum_of_digits       4/4       100      NONE      Straight-line logic; full statement coverage.
2 – is_palindrome       5/5       100      NONE      Pure expression build; no conditional branches exercised.
3 – fibonacci           4/4       100      100       Iterative loop hit for all test sizes.
4 – factorial           5/5       100      100       Happy-path + negative-input error path covered.
5 – count_vowels        4/4       100      NONE      Only linear comprehension; all statements executed.
6 – find_max            2/3       100      100       Benchmark suite exposed missing support for all-negative lists (assertion failure).
7 – reverse_words       4/4       100      NONE      No conditional logic; coverage trivial.
8 – is_prime            5/5       91       90        Even-number fast-exit branch never taken; only odd cases in benchmark tests.
9 – merge_dicts         4/4       100      100       All merge paths exercised by provided assertions.
10 – second_largest     5/5       100      100       Duplicate-handling path covered via provided failure case.
